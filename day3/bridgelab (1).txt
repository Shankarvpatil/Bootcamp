1 i). Print EmployeeName and TotalPay who has BasePay greater than 10000
=>cat data.csv 
awk '{if($4>10000) print $2 "     " $7}'

ii).What is the aggregate TotalPay of employees whose jobtitle is 'CAPTAIN
=>grep CAPTAIN data.csv



iii).Print JobTitle and Overtimepay who has Overtimepay is between 7000 and 10000
=>awk '{if($5>7000 && $5<10000) print $3 "    " $5 }' data.csv

iv). Print average BasePay
=>awk '{sum+=$4 ; count++} END {print sum/count}' data.csv

2.Find the difference between original file and the updated file. Apply changes to the original file.
=>[ -z "$VARIABLE" ] && usersecret="dH34xjaa23"


if env | grep -q ^VARIABLE=

then
  
	echo env variable is already exported

else
  
	echo env variable was not exported, but now it is
  export VARIABLE

fi

3.Chcek if a folder exists or not.

if it's not present, create it. 
=> if [ -d "test" ] 

then
    
	echo "Directory test exists." 

else
    
	mkdir test
    
	echo "Error: test does not exists."	

fi

4.Execute command hello and ls and check its execution status and print whether command is successfully executed or not.
ls

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
   
echo "succsess"

	echo "FAIL"

fi

hello

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
	
	echo "success"


else
	
	echo "fail"

fi

5. Set Environment usersecret="dH34xJaa23" if its already not set

if(env | grep "usersecret"); then
  
  echo "already exported"

else

  export usersecret=dH34xJaa23

fi

6.Find a word "systemd" from all log files in the folder /var/log and print number of occurence more than 0 against each file.
=> for log in ls /var/log/*.log

do
	
	count=grep -c 'systemd' $log
	
	if [ $count != 0 ]
	
	then

		echo $count
	
	fi

done
 6. Create processlist table displays process id, parent process id, command name,% of memory consumption,% of cpu utilization
=>i.ps -elf
 ii.ps -o pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,pcpu

7.Find the difference between original file and the updated file. Apply changes to the original file.
=> -q for only to check difference is present or not
   -iEZ to check what is content and difference in the file
